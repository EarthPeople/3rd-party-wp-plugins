# 3rd Party WordPress Plugins
A list of third party WP plugins we like to use. 

## A checklist for evaluating plugins:
- Is it version controlled and stable?
- Is there a vivid community around it?
- Does it have a track-record?
- Is it maintained? 
- Has anyone we know used it before?
- Does it not add a lot of extra scripts/styles?
