# 3rd Party WordPress Plugins
A list of third party WP plugins we like to use.

## A checklist for evaluating plugins:
- Is it version controlled and stable?
- Is there a vivid community around it?
- Does it have a track-record?
- Is it maintained?
- Has anyone we know used it before?
- Does it not add a lot of extra scripts/styles?

## Plugins

#### [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)
Super easy custom fields!

#### [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/)
Clone posts and pages. Has support for filters/actions, so you easily can extend it to copy more stuff. Especially useful in development for quickly creating a lot of placeholder content.

#### [Enhanced Media Library PRO](https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/enhanced-media-library/)
Categories and tags for media items. PRO also adds bulk editing.

#### [Simple History](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-history/)
Keeps an event log of what the users of the site has been up to, whats posts have they edited, what images have they uploaded, what plugins have they installed, and so on.

#### [Slash Edit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/slash-edit/)
Edit your posts or pages with a simple "/edit" at the end. The readme says it all:

This is useful if:

- You are not logged in, and want an easy shortcut to edit an item.
- You hate the admin bar and have disabled it, but still want an easy shortcut to edit an item.


#### [User Switching](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/)
Instant switching between user accounts in WordPress. Switching back to original account is just a click away too.

#### [WP Crontrol](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/)
Manage and view all cron events.

#### [WP Offload S3 Lite](https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/)
Copies uploaded files from media library to Amazon S3 and then replaces the URL to each media file with their respective Amazon S3 URL.

#### [W3 Total Cache](https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)
